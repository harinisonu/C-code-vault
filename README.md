# C Programming Practice Repository

üëã Welcome to my C programming practice repo! This repository contains a growing collection of C programs and coding exercises that I‚Äôve been working on as part of my learning journey. Right now, the focus is on building a strong foundation with basic concepts and syntax.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `PracticeCodes/`  
  Contains simple programs that explore basic C syntax, operators, loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and pointers.

- `ProblemSolving/`  
  Includes my attempts at solving beginner-friendly coding challenges. I'm actively learning, debugging, and improving these solutions as I go.

## üß† Learning in Progress

These programs are part of my ongoing journey in mastering C. I'm continuously updating, editing, and optimizing the code to fix bugs, explore edge cases, and improve performance. Expect improvements and new topics over time as I deepen my understanding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Compiler: Code::Blocks
- OS: Windows
- Editor: Code::Blocks IDE

## üìå How to Run

1. Open Code::Blocks.
2. Load any `.c` file from `PracticeCodes/` or `ProblemSolving/`.
3. Click "Build and Run" to compile and execute.

## ‚úçÔ∏è About Me

I'm an embedded software developer expanding my low-level programming skills through practice and self-learning. This repo reflects my hands-on exploration of C programming and complements my work with microcontrollers and embedded systems.
